## 📖 Project Overview & Understanding

The electric mobility sector in India is expanding rapidly with government support, rising fuel costs, and increased environmental awareness. This dashboard explores key dimensions such as:

- Sales by manufacturer and state
- Revenue generated by vehicle category (2W vs 4W)
- EV penetration trends across regions
- Infrastructure insights like charging stations
- Side-by-side state comparisons

It is designed to help policymakers, analysts, and industry professionals understand EV market dynamics in India.

## 🔢 Key DAX Measures Used

DAX
 ---Total EV Sales
TotalEVSales = SUM(Sales[EV_Units])

-- Total Revenue
TotalRevenue = SUM(Sales[Revenue])

-- EV Penetration %
EVPenetration = DIVIDE([TotalEVSales], [TotalVehiclesSold], 0)

-- Year-on-Year Growth %
YoYGrowth = 
VAR PrevYear = CALCULATE([TotalEVSales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Date[Date]))
RETURN DIVIDE([TotalEVSales] - PrevYear, PrevYear, 0)

-- Market Share by Maker
MarketShare = 
DIVIDE([TotalEVSales], CALCULATE([TotalEVSales], ALL(Makers[Maker])), 0)

-- Revenue by Category
CategoryRevenue = 
CALCULATE([TotalRevenue], FILTER(Sales, Sales[Category] = "2W"))
## 🧠 Insights Gained

- Better understanding of EV diffusion across India
- Visualization of state-level adoption patterns
- Manufacturer competitiveness and market dynamics
- Revenue-driven category split (2W dominates ~90%)
